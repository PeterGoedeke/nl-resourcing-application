# nl-resourcing-application

To run application please download the folder named 'Built Application' and run 'nl-resourcing-application.exe'.

This build will only run on windows machines. I have additional builds of the application which are capable of running on alternate operating systems; however, I elected not to upload these to the respository for the sake of saving storage space and internet data.
