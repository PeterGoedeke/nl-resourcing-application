- Create employee slot buttons can overlap employee slots
- Positioner can get too long, meaning that you can scroll too far in either direction
- If you let go of the drag while your mouse is over the sidebar it isn't so great
- All little text boys need to highlight on select
- sq doesn't need to use the module pattern (neither does state and some other things)
- Dragging the left side of a project far towards the right bugs out (potentially the same for the other direction)
- Employee slots can be entirely out of their projects
- Tab order of the right sidebar is bad
- There was a bug where getting the employee from name was running when it wasn't meant to (even when the employee didn't exist)
- EmployeeSlot input needs to be checked properly to see whether it is a number

- Projects security status
- Employee dialogue for leaving and joining and all of that
- Zooming
- Viewing and adding of different employee types

- Undo?

- What should happen when leave and workload overlaps, should there be an indicator?
