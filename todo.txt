- Positioner can get too long, meaning that you can scroll too far in either direction
- Dragging the left side of a project far towards the right bugs out (potentially the same for the other direction)

- Lags when lots of projects are added and you scroll
- Labels start too big and get smaller when things are added
- The separators need to be in front of the rest of the display
- Buttons for adding employee slots get out of position when zoomed out
- Attempting to resize a project to zero from the left drags it to the side in a weird way
- End of the project is out of line with the gridlines
- Add display for zooming

- Projects security status
- Employee dialogue for leaving and joining and all of that
- Zooming
- Reading and writing information to files
- Total rows
- Leave should just show as 5
- Min height for projects
- There needs to be a catch if you try and remove all employee types
- Deletion of Employee Types
- Project shouldn't create an employee type to begin with
- Timeblocks need grid children

- Undo?
- How do you want sub-types of employee to be implemented?
- Ctrl + scroll = zoom?
- Is it a problem that employee slots can be entirely out of their projects?
- What do you want the tab order of the application to be?
- How do you want the behaviour of extending the duration of a project to work with the employee slots?
- Resizing isn't nice at small sizes, what do you want me to do about it?
- Do you need finer resizing?

- What to do with projects which should have 0 of a type of employee?
- What should happen when leave and workload overlaps, should there be an indicator?




- Rewrite reading files with promises
- Rewrite screen display in a more screen moduled fashion and use css flow better



Meeting with Client:
- Change leave to 5
- Give projects a minimum height
