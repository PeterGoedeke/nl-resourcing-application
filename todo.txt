- Create employee slot buttons can overlap employee slots
- Positioner can get too long, meaning that you can scroll too far in either direction
- If you let go of the drag while your mouse is over the sidebar it isn't so great
- All little text boys need to highlight on select
- Dragging the left side of a project far towards the right bugs out (potentially the same for the other direction)
- Employee slots can be entirely out of their projects
- Tab order of the right sidebar is bad
- There was a bug where getting the employee from name was running when it wasn't meant to (even when the employee didn't exist)
- EmployeeSlot input needs to be checked properly to see whether it is a number
- TypeLabel starts too large
- Text isn't vertically centred in the type label and the other things in the left sidebar
- EmployeeSlots need to extend with the extension of a project
- Lags when lots of projects are added and you scroll

- Projects security status
- Employee dialogue for leaving and joining and all of that
- Zooming
- Reading and writing information to files
- Total rows
- Leave should just show as 5
- Min height for projects
- There needs to be a catch if you try and remove all employee types
- Deletion of Employee Types
- Project shouldn't create an employee type to begin with

- Undo?
- How do you want sub-types of employee to be implemented?

- What to do with projects which should have 0 of a type of employee?
- What should happen when leave and workload overlaps, should there be an indicator?
