To-do list:
- Add an interiors stream
- Arrow key navigation
- Add an undo button
- Touchscreen
- Make things look nice

Unimportant bugs:
- Date row doesn't work below 2000
- Positioner can get too long, meaning that you can scroll too far in either direction
- Can't scroll by scrolling the sidebar
- There is a bug where groups can stick around

Important bugs:
- Horizontal lines go in front of to axis container
- Vertical lines go in front of sidebar
- Doesn't scroll down far enough

Notes:
- I changed the joining and marking behaviour
- Client wanted arrow key navigation

Questions for client:
- Autoremove based on the current date?

- How do you want the months to show when it's smaller? Drop the year
- Should projects create an employee to begin with? Yes
- Do you need to be able to hide stuff before a certain date manually?
- Is it a problem that you can enter negative workloads? Yes
- How do you want join and leave dates to be removed?
- Do you want me to change marking employee leave and start dates to just where did they open the dialogue? Leave it cool

Optimization ideas:
- Everything gets called a millions times when loading
- When zoomed out remove workload blocks and make them appear on click
- Only update the vertical display of objects before the one changed (every object can have an index property)
- Should cache some functions
- Add console logs to each function and see when they're called when they shouldn't be

Possible refactorings:
- Rewrite reading files with promises
- Rewrite screen display in a more screen moduled fashion and use css flow better
- Split saveload into two files
- Replace let for in loops with const for in loops
- Replace most mouseup event listeners with HTML5 onclicks
- Rewrite dialogues with mixins
- Dialogues.js is in the wrong folder
- Merge all the 'keydown' arrow key navigation event listeners
