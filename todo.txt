- Create employee slot buttons can overlap employee slots
- Positioner can get too long, meaning that you can scroll too far in either direction
- If you let go of the drag while your mouse is over the sidebar it isn't so great
- All little text boys need to highlight on select
- sq doesn't need to use the module pattern
- Earliest and latest dates need to change at more times
- Employee slots can be entirely out of their projects
- Tab order of the right sidebar is bad
- There was a bug where getting the employee from name was running when it wasn't meant to (even when the employee didn't exist)
- EmployeeSlot input needs to be checked properly to see whether it is a number
