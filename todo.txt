Version two:
- Printing
- Moving employees around

- Scrolling with touchscreen isn't working properly
- Scrolling too far to the right breaks the horizontal display of the application
- Unsecured and grouping simultaneously, with unsecured taking precedence
- Ask about the surplus / deficit row and how its including empty rows and all of that

Most recent update:
- Every six months have a double vertical line (single lines are sometimes too thick)
- Laggy when you move from tab to tab
- Move the employee slot create buttons 
- Lines don't go all the way down all of the time
- Decimal values for days a week
- Things go out of line when there is a lot of information in the program
- Make leave narrower and get rid of the plus sign
- Make it grey hash when they're leaving or joining
- Need to be able to change the maximum and the minimum
- Add scrollbars to the application
- Add an empty row

To-do list:
- Open at current date
- Add an interiors stream
- Add undo
- Loading screen

- Make leave etc collapsable?
- Employee slots are too small when they're just one date
- Open at current date
- Zooming is laggy and it would be good to have a cookie for zoom
- Create employee slot button should be on the left
- Part time employees doesn't recognise decimals

- Touchscreen

Unimportant bugs:
- Positioner can get too long, meaning that you can scroll too far in either direction
- Can't scroll by scrolling the sidebar. Doesn't matter
- There is a bug where groups can stick around
- Vertical lines go in front of sidebar

Notes:
- I changed the joining and marking behaviour
- Client wanted arrow key navigation
- Doesn't want undo anymore!
- Make the scrollbar look like a scrollbar and be more obvious

Questions for client:
- Autoremove based on the current date?
- Should I remove the button in the corner?

- Date row doesn't work below 2000 Not important
- How do you want the months to show when it's smaller? Drop the year
- Should projects create an employee to begin with? Yes
- Do you need to be able to hide stuff before a certain date manually?
- Is it a problem that you can enter negative workloads? Yes
- How do you want join and leave dates to be removed?
- Do you want me to change marking employee leave and start dates to just where did they open the dialogue? Leave it cool

Optimization ideas:
- Everything gets called a millions times when loading
- When zoomed out remove workload blocks and make them appear on click
- Only update the vertical display of objects before the one changed (every object can have an index property)
- Should cache some functions
- Add console logs to each function and see when they're called when they shouldn't be

Possible refactorings:
- Rewrite reading files with promises
- Rewrite screen display in a more screen moduled fashion and use css flow better
- Split saveload into two files
- Replace let for in loops with const for in loops
- Replace most mouseup event listeners with HTML5 onclicks
- Rewrite dialogues with mixins
- Dialogues.js is in the wrong folder
- Merge all the 'keydown' arrow key navigation event listeners
