Meeting with Client:
- Change leave to 5
- Give projects a minimum height
- Unsecured Projects only change the appearance, not the data

Optimization ideas:
- When zoomed out remove workload blocks and make them appear on click
- Only update the vertical display of objects before the one changed (every object can have an index property)
- Should cache some functions
- Add console logs to each function and see when they're called when they shouldn't be
