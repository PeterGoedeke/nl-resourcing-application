To-do list:
- Leave should be shown as five instead of white
- Unsecured projects should float to the bottom
- Employees need to be able to be marked as leaving and joining
- Need to be able to group projects
- Autocomplete while assigning employees
- Add an interiors stream
- Add total rows for regular and interiors
- Arrow key navigation
- Employee displays need to have orange zeros the entire time
- Add an undo button
- Make maximum zoom two years
- Touchscreen

Known bugs:
- Positioner can get too long, meaning that you can scroll too far in either direction
- Can't scroll by scrolling the sidebar
- Lag when you zoom out and can see a lot of elements
- Update Vertical Display is called heaps when loading
- Employee displays are out of line with the vertical gridlines

Questions for client:
- Do you need finer resizing?
- Should projects create an employee to begin with?
- Should it load in a little bit scrolled along to the current date or something?
- Do you need to be able to hide stuff before a certain date manually?
- Is it a problem that you can enter negative workloads?

Optimization ideas:
- When zoomed out remove workload blocks and make them appear on click
- Only update the vertical display of objects before the one changed (every object can have an index property)
- Should cache some functions
- Add console logs to each function and see when they're called when they shouldn't be

Possible refactorings:
- Rewrite reading files with promises
- Rewrite screen display in a more screen moduled fashion and use css flow better
- Split saveload into two files
- Split setup into multiple files
- Replace let for in loops with const for in loops
